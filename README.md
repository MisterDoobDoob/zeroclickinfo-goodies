# What is this

Tried to fix an error in the Mozilla firefox shortcuts, see [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/pull/4794). Unfortunately, DuckDuckHack is on indefinite hiatus so the answer is still wrong, but I leave this here just in case anyone wants to see ðŸ˜‚. If you want to fix this locally, you will need to use [DuckPan](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan), but I wasn't successful in getting it working. Best of luck to you!
